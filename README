README

Follow the github directions to setup git and clone the repository on your 
machine before you start working: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git

Alternatively you can use GitHub for Windows to setup everything via the GUI
and it takes care of all the authentication business. More info at:
https://windows.github.com/
