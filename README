README

Follow the github directions to setup git and clone the repository on your 
machine before you start working: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git

Alternatively you can use GitHub for Windows to setup everything via the GUI
and it takes care of all the authentication business. More info at:
https://windows.github.com/

Also -- HELLO WORLD!

CLONING:

I'm assuming all authentication work is done per instructions and I highly
recommend using SSH rather than HTTPS.

1. Open up git-bash
2. git clone git@github.com:CentralizedTango/tango.git

PUSHING CHANGES:

1. Open up git-bash
2. cd to the directory where you've put in the files.
3. git add <all the files you want to add>
(you can use git status if you are not sure which files need staging for commit)
4. git commit -m "<message>"
5. git remote add origin git@github.com:CentralizedTango/tango.git
6. git push -u origin master

You're done!
