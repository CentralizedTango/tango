Initial Set of Ideas

Platforms: Web, Android, iOS

Ideas in no particular order:
1. Highly updated list of events 'nearby'
2. Ability for event organizers to add events
 2a. Types of events like festivals, milongas, practicas, classes, workshops etc.
 2b. Venue information, pricing, times.
3. "Tango Now" suggests events based on time of day, user prefs, location etc.
4. Event listings by day & location
5. Event listings by 'specific day' & location
6. Web OR Mobile interface for adding events (probably web is more useful)
7. Site crawler perhaps if webmasters don't want to co-operate?
8. How to ensure absolute accuracy in presented information (bread & butter)
9. "Tanguero/Tanguera" -- Connect people using the app if they are close by
 9a. Use Facebook/Twitter/Google+ integration for location information
 9b. Provide a way for users to reveal themselves through the app if necessary
 9c. Let's try not to store ANY user information on our servers.
10. Tango glossary (might be useful for newbies)
11. Where to host?
12. What's the name of the app?
13. How to gather further requirements?
14. Exercises or movement videos (Really really can't see this happening but
    putting it out there just in case someone really wants to work on it)
